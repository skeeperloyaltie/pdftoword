# PDF to Word Converter

This script converts PDF documents in a specified folder to editable Word documents (.docx), ensuring that all text is editable and images are correctly aligned. It uses the `pdf2docx` library primarily and falls back to `PyMuPDF` if the primary conversion fails.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pdf2docx` library
- `python-docx` library
- `PyMuPDF` library

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install pdf2docx python-docx PyMuPDF
```
